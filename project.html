                        <p class="project-desc">The website is a simple flower shop design that showcases different indoor plants 
                            with their names, pictures, and prices. It has clear sections like Home, About, Products, and Contact 
                            Us, making it easy to explore and understand what the shop offers. The goal of the site is to present 
                            the plants in a neat and visually pleasing way, while also giving visitors the basic information they 
                            need if they were interested in buying.</p>

                        <p class="project-desc">The website Taste Of Travel is a food-blog style page inviting visitors to explore 
                            the bold flavors of Thai cuisine. It highlights a featured recipe — Tom Yum Goong — with detailed sections 
                            for ingredients, preparation steps, and cooking tips. Through descriptive text and visual cues (like an 
                            image of the Thai soup), it communicates not just how to cook a dish, but why its flavor components (sweet, 
                            sour, salty, spicy) matter. The site combines storytelling and culinary education to engage food lovers and 
                            home cooks.</p>

                            listen to their latest tracks, embedded performance clips, upcoming tour dates, social media follow-links, 
                            and a contact form. The overall aim is to connect with visitors via music and performance, making it easy

                            minimalistic by design—just enough to demonstrate basic HTML skills and give a first impression of the 
                            author’s ability to put content online.</p>

                            some placeholder text (“Lorem ipsum …”) and a header image, which suggests this page is built to practice 
                            form layout, user input fields, and basic design structure.</p>

                            email, phone number, and preferred method of contact. It also requests the date of first school visit and a 
                            short self-description in three words. The layout focuses on collecting structured inputs in a clean, 
                            straightforward manner.</p>
